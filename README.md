# vacuum_tube_rectifiers
This is a pet project that involves transferring the muchly underrated and wonderful book "Vacuum Tube Rectifiers" by Alexander Schure from 1958.

The PDF of the book can be found in the tubebooks.org archive: http://www.tubebooks.org/books/schure_rectifiers.pdf

It's wonderful and needs to be out there more, so I'm going to see what I can do.
