Rectifier Circuit Design Data

Table 1 summarizes the main characteristic and design factors of the various rectifier circuits discussed in Chaps. 2 and 3. The significance of these factors has been described in detail in Chaps. 2 and 3, but it may be well to explain the derivation and use of the table, and in the process recapitulate the meaning of the various design factors.

All numerical factors in Table 1 are ratios based on a DC output voltage of l volt, or a DC output of I amp. In the case of the secondary ac voltages and currents, the numbers express the ratio of the rms value of the voltage or current to the DC output voltage or current. The average current per tube expresses the fraction contributed by each tube to the total DC output (taken as I). The value of the peak current per tube expresses the ratio of the peak value of the output current waveform to its average or DC value, taken as I. This is the inverse of the average-to-peak current (or voltage) ratio, previously stated in Chaps. 2 and 3 for various circuits. For example, it was stated that the average current of single-phase, full-wave rectifier is 0.636 times the peak current. In Table I the inverse ratio (peak current to average current) is listed as 1.57, which evidently is 1/0.636. Note, however, that the peak-to-average ratios assume that nothing is done to change the output current waveform of the rectifier. In other words, the rectifier must be connected directly to a pure resistance load, so that the full ripple in the output waveform is present. If the rectifier is connected to a filter, the output waveform is changed by suppression of the ripple and the average current or voltage values begin to approach the peak values. The values listed in Table 1 do not apply to filter operation. In the case of an "ideal" choke-input filter (with infinite input inductance), for example, the current ripple is entirely suppressed and the average DC load current becomes equal to the peak current per plate. (The exception is the double-wye, three-phase circuit, where the peak current per-tube must be held to one-half of the average DC current, as explained in Chap. 3).

Table 1 also lists the rms ripple voltage as a percentage of the de output voltage. These values were obtained by taking the root-mean-square value of the sum of the fundamental and harmonic ripple voltage amplitudes. The values stated represent the combined effect of all ripple components present in the rectifier output. This is useful for filter calculations.

The values listed in Table I for the secondary winding voltages and currents (Es and Is, respectively) assume that no voltage is lost in the transformer windings and across the tubes. To obtain actual values for the required secondary voltages and currents in a specific circuit, the voltage drop across the transformer secondary windings and the tube voltage drops must be added to the value obtained from Table I. Manufacturer's component data and tube manuals may be consulted to obtain the tube and transformer drops.

The kva (kilovolt-amperes) values listed in Table I for the transformer primary permit estimating current-handling requirements of the transformer and its required kva rating. Note the excessive kva rating for the single-phase, half-wave circuit; this is caused by the DC saturation of the unbalanced rectified current flowing through the transformer secondary, as was explained in Chap. 2. The kva rating represents the input power including the reactive component. To obtain the true input power the kva value must be multiplied by the power factor of the circuit. Both the kva and the power factor listing assume that there are no losses in the transformer. To obtain true values these losses must be added to the listed values.

As is apparent from Table I, the relation between the peak inverse voltage per tube and the DC output voltage depends on the rectifier circuit. The listings represent minimum values calculated for sinewave conditions. Because of the presence of line surges and other transients a safety factor should be allowed for the peak inverse voltage per tube. Tubes should be selected (from Table II) whose peak inverse voltage rating exceeds the required values listed in Table I for the particular circuit used.

The proper use of Table I will become evident through the examples of rectifier calculations, worked out later on in the chapter. For complete rectifier-filter circuit design all the tables in this chapter must be used in conjunction with each other.
