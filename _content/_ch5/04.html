<h3>Typical Rectifier-Filter Calculations</h3>

<p>The two examples below illustrate the procedures to be followed for designing rectifier-.filter systems, using the design data provided in this chapter and manufacturer's tube data.</p>

<p>Example 1: A single-phase, 60-cycle, full-wave rectifier is required to. supply to the filter and load a DC output voltage of 430 volts at a load current of 225 ma, and should have a ripple not exceeding 1%. Choose tubes, filter, and component values.</p>

<p>Solution: (Refer to Fig. 30.) From Table I, the peak inverse voltage on the rectifier tube will be 3.14 x 430 = 1,350 volts, and the peak plate current is 1.57 x 225 = 354 ma.</p>

<p>From Table III it is apparent that a 5U4-G full-wave rectifier tube will easily and economically meet these requirements.</p>

<p>Referring to the manufacturer's receiving tube manual, it is seen that either a choke-input or capacitor-input filter will be able to supply the required DC output voltage and current, but a choke-input filter. will necessitate a plate-to-plate transformer secondary voltage of l 100 volts (550 volts each leg), while the capacitor-input filter requires only 900 volts secondary plate-to-plate voltage. A capacitor-input filter will thus permit the use of a less expensive power transformer, although its voltage regulation will be poorer than that of the choke-input type. Choosing a capacitor-input filter for economy, we see from the tube manual that an input capacitor of 10 microfarads will give a DC output voltage of 430 volts into the filter at the desired load current of 225 ma (112.5 ma per plate). The tube manual also states that the regulation from half load to full load (112.5 ma to 225 ma) is 80 volts.</p>

<p>To design the filter, refer to Table II, which gives for one section an L-C product of about 83 for a ripple voltage of 11% of the output (or 4.3 volts ac). Since the input capacitor is 10 microfarads; the minimum series inductance of the section should be 83 / 10 or 8.3 henrys. A practical value of 9 henrys will be more than sufficient. Allowing about a 25-volt drop in the choke, the output voltage from the filter will be 405 volts at full load.</p>

<p>A bleeder resistor drawing about IO% of the load, or about 20 ma, should be connected across the filter output. By Ohms Law its resistance should be 430/.02 = 21,500 ohms and its wattage rating must be more than 430 x .02 = 8.6 watts. For safety, a rating of 15 to 20 watts should be selected.</p>

<p>The DC output power of the rectifier is the product of output voltage and full load current or 430 x 0.225 = 97 watts (approximately). Adding about 15% or 15 watts to take care of bleeder requirements, tube and transformer drops, the total DC power is about 112 watts. The kva rating from Table I is 1.1 I times the de output power or 1.11 x 1112 = 125 kilovolt-amperes. In practice, a transformer with a rating of about 135 to 150 kva should be chosen.</p>

<p>Example 2: It is desired to design a 60-cycle, three-phase, half-wave rectifier filter circuit capable of delivering a DC output of 3,500 volts at 3 amperes maximum load current, and with a ripple not exceeding 0.5% of the output voltage.</p>

<p>Solution: (Refer to Figure 31.) Reference to Table I shows that the peak inverse voltage that each rectifier tube must withstand is 3,500 x 2.09 = 7,320 volts and the peak plate current per tube is 3 x l.21 = 3.63 amperes; the average plate current is 3 x 0.333 = 1 ampere each tube. Inspection of Table III reveals that the lowest-power tube capable of meeting these requirements is the type 872-A, half-wave mercury-vapor tube. For a three-phase, half-wave rectifier three 872-A's will be needed.</p>

<p>Neglecting the DC resistance of the filter choke, each secondary leg of the power transformer must develop an rms voltage of 3,500 x 0.855 = 3000 volts (see Table I) and provide a secondary current of 3 x 0.58 = 1.74 amperes. Plus 10% for tube, transformer and filter drops, the secondary voltage per leg should be about 3,300 volts. Since the output power is 3,500 x 3 = 10.5 kw, the kva rating of the transformer primary (from Table I) should be 10.5 x 1.2 = 12. 7 kva. Adding again 10% to compensate for losses, the transformer should be rated at 14 kva. In addition, a filament winding must be provided, rated at 5 volts, 22.5 amperes, to supply the 5-volt, 7.5-ampere filaments of the three rectifier tubes.</p>

<p>A choke-input filter must be used, since this is the only type applicable to polyphase circuits. Assuming a minimum load current (bleeder or voltage divider) of 10% of the total, (0.3 ampere), the minimum input inductance (from Table II) becomes</p>

<p>A choke rated 3 henrys at full load should prove adequate. For a permissible ripple of 0.5% of the output, the chart (Table II) gives an L-C product of about 30 for the three-phase, half-wave circuit. The value of the shunt capacitor, therefore, is</p>

<p>The value of the bleeder resistor (if one is provided) to draw 10% of the load current, or 0.3 ampere, should be 3,500/0.3 = 11,667 ohms and its wattage rating must exceed 3,500 x 0.3 = 1050 watts. (The high power rating will probably make it uneconomical to use a bleeder.)</p>
