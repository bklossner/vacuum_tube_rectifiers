<ol>
    <li>What is the chief application of high-vacuum rectifier tubes and at what power level would you begin to use mercury-vapor tubes. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?</li>
    <li>Explain the significance of the rectifier design data in Table I. Why are the transformer requirements for a single-phase, half-wave circuit excessively high?</li>
    <li>Describe the effect of resistive, capacitive, and inductive loading of the rectifier output on the ratio of peak to average current per tube.</li>
    <li>What allowance should be made, when using Table I, for voltage drops lost in tubes, transformer windings, filter, etc.</li>
    <li>How would you obtain the true power rating of a transformer from its kva rating in a specific circuit, using Table I?</li>
    <li>Explain the normal design procedure for a choke-input filter, using Table II. What current would you use to compute the minimum input inductance of the choke?</li>
    <li>Design a capacitor-input filter, using Table II, that will give a ripple of O.1% with a three-phase, 60-cycle, full-wave circuit. If the shunt capacitance is 5 microfarads, what should be the value of the inductance? Express the ripple in db.</li>
    <li>Design a single-phase, half-wave rectifier (60 cycles) that will give 250 volts DC output at a load of 125 ma. Choose a filter, select tubes, and state all component values, including a bleeder resistor.</li>
    <li>Design a 60-cycle, three-phase, full-wave (delta-wye) rectifier-filter system with a choke-input filter providing an output of 8,000 volts DC at 5 amperes load current. The ripple voltage should not exceed 0.04% of the DC output voltage.</li>
