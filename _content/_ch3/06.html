<h3>Three-Phase Full-Wave Delta-Wye Rectifier</h3>

<p>The full-wave delta-wye (sometimes called the three-phase, full-wave bridge circuit) rectifier circuit shown in Fig. 20 is essentially an extension of the single-phase full-wave bridge rectifier, described in the last chapter (Fig. 10). Although this circuit uses double the number of tubes of the three-phase, half-wave, delta-wye rectifier (Fig. 16), it has the advantage of delivering twice the output voltage of the half-wave rectifier for the same total secondary voltage (Es).</p>

<p>Note in Fig. 20 that each leg of the secondary wye is connected to the junction of two half-wave rectifiers, arranged back-to-back, so that full-wave rectification of both ac half-cycles is obtained from each phase. The waveform of the output voltage, shown at right in Fig. 20, is essentially the same as that of the double-wye circuit (Fig. 18), where the ripple-frequency of the output is six times that of the three-phase ac supply.</p>

<p>No balance coil is required, but the power transformer must have three secondary windings and the filament transformer must have four separate secondary windings, one for V1, V2, and V3, and one each for V4, V5, and V6. Since the rectified tube currents flow in opposing directions through the secondaries, no DC magnetization can take place. Three single-phase transformers may be used in place of one three-phase transformer.</p>

<p>As in the delta-star circuit, the average DC load current is 0.955 times the peak current through each tube, but one-third of the de load current flows through each tube (rather than one-sixth, as in the delta-star circuit), because two tubes are required for each output current pulse. As pointed out before, the average DC output voltage is twice that of the three-phase half-wave rectifier, or 2 x 1.17 = 2.34 times the rms value of the ac voltage across each secondary leg. Conversely, the rms voltage across each leg need be only 1/2.34 or 0.428 times the value of the average desired dc output voltage.</p>

<p>Example: The transformer secondary voltage per leg (Es) in a full-wave delta-wye rectifier is 150 volts rms, the load current 2 amperes. What is the average DC output voltage, the peak and average current through each tube, and the average power delivered to the load?</p>

<p>Solution: Since the average DC output voltage is 2.34 times the rms voltage across each leg, the output voltage is 2.34 x 150 = 351 volts. The peak current through each tube is 1/0.955 or 1.05 times the average load current; the peak current is 1.05 x 2 = 2.10 amperes per tube. The average current per tube is one-third of the total, or 1 /3 x 2=0.667 ampere. Finally, the average power is the product of the average current and the output voltage, or 2 x 351 = 702 watts.</p>
