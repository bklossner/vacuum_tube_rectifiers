<h3>Review Questions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>State some of the advantages of three-phase power systems over single-phase supplies.</li>
    <li>Draw the circuit and output waveform of a three-phase half-wave delta-wye rectifier and explain its operation.</li>
    <li>What is the advantage of the delta-zig-zag connection over the delta-wye circuit? Is there any difference in the output waveform of the circuit; in the average and peak currents; in the ripple frequency?</li>
    <li>Why is the half-wave double-wye circuit sometimes called a six-phase rectifier? What is the ripple frequency of the output?</li>
    <li>Explain the function of the interphase balance coil in the double-wye circuit and how it affects the ratio of the peak current per tube to the average load current. Compare ratio with that of the half-wave delta-wye rectifier.</li>
    <li>Compare the operation of a double-wye circuit with that of the delta-star rectifier connection. How would you convert one into the other?</li>
    <li>A broadcast station requires a DC voltage of 2000 volts at a load current of 10 amperes. For both the delta-star rectifier (Fig. 19) and the double-wye circuit (Fig. 18) compute the required rms voltage across each secondary winding of the transformer, the peak and average current per tube, the DC power delivered to the load and the ripple frequency. (Neglect the tube and transformer voltage drops.) Which circuit would you choose?</li>
    <li>Draw the circuit of a three-phase full-wave delta-wye rectifier and compare its operation with that of a single-phase, full-wave bridge rectifier. Compute the same data as for the review question (7) and compare all three circuits. If you had three single-phase transformers of the proper ratings available, would you change your selection in question (7)?</li>
    <li>Remembering the delta connection, draw the circuit of a three-phase full-wave delta-delta rectifier.</li>
