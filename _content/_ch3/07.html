<h3>Uses of Polyphase Circuits</h3>

<p>Polyphase rectifiers are used only when the efficiency of rectification is more important than the cost of the rectifier itself. This is generally the case when the required DC power exceeds about 1 kilowatt. Many industrial plants, broadcast and television stations requiring up to 20,000 volts DC at peak currents of 10 amperes or more utilize polyphase circuits. The tubes employed are generally the gas-filled (mercury-vapor) type. Polyphase circuits also have the advantage over single-phase types of developing fairly steady output voltages that require little filtering. Finally, the more efficient polyphase circuits give a higher output voltage relative to the peak inverse voltage of the tube and utilize the power transformer more efficiently than do equivalent single-phase circuits.</p>
