<h3>The Need for Polyphase Circuits</h3>

<p>Practically all alternating-current power is transmitted over three wires in a three-phase circuit. In such a circuit the voltage appearing between any two wires is 120Â° out of phase with the voltages appearing across the other two pairs. Each wire serves to some extent as a return wire for the other two, permitting a considerable saving in copper. This and other advantages increase the efficiency and power utilization of three-phase systems to such an extent over a single-phase supply that practically all large-scale industrial power consumers utilize three-phase power. (The ordinary house current uses one phase of a three-phase system.) Since many industrial processes require DC power, however, polyphase rectifier circuits are needed. Because of the heavy current requirements, gas-filled diodes, such as mercury-vapor tubes and ignitrons, are frequently employed in polyphase rectifiers.</p>

<p>When a three-phase power supply is available, advantage is taken of its high efficiency by connecting the rectifier tubes in 3-, 6-, and 12-phase circuits. All are derived from the basic three-phase supply. Two-phase power supplies and their associated rectifiers are of little interest because of their relatively low efficiency. Despite the multiplicity of possible rectifier circuits for polyphase systems, only a few of importance in electronics will be discussed.</p>
