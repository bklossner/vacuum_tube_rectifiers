<h3>Three-Phase Half-Wave Delta-Wye Rectifier</h3>

<p>The simplest of the three-phase rectifiers is the half-wave delta-wye circuit, shown in Fig. 16. The terms "delta" (&delta;) and· "wye" (Y) refer to the configuration of the primary and secondary coils, respectively, of the three-phase transformer.</p>

<p>Note in Fig. 16 that the three-phase line is connected to the junctions of three delta-connected primary coils, so that the full primary voltage (Ep) of each phase is developed across each coil. The three secondary coils of the transformer are mounted in the shape of a wye and a secondary voltage (Es) is developed across each coil or leg. These secondary voltages are 120° out of phase with each other; that is, the output sinewave of each coil is displaced in time by 120&deg;, or one-third of a cycle, with respect to the sinewaves of the other two coils.</p>

<p>The circuit shown in Fig. 16 consists essentially of three separate half-wave rectifiers, one for each leg of the secondary wye, or one for each phase. The operation of each half-wave rectifier is identical to that described for the single-phase half-wave rectifier, illustrated in Fig. 5 and 6. Each tube carries current only during the positive half-cycles of its phase, or only one-third of the time. The output voltage, therefore, fluctuates at three times the ac supply frequency, as shown in the waveform of Fig. 16. This permits easy filtering of the ripple.</p>

<p>Although each of the rectifier tubes is only a half-wave unit, the cathode currents of all the tubes flow through the common load resistance, so the average DC load current is much higher relative to the peak current than in a single-phase rectifier. The average DC current of a three-phase half-wave rectifier is 0.826 times the peak current, compared to a value of 0.318 for the same ratio in the single-phase, half-wave circuit, and 0.636 for the single-phase, full-wave circuit. Because of this high average current value, the DC output voltage is correspondingly high, and as a matter of fact, it is greater than the ac rms voltage of each secondary leg by a factor of 1.17. (The peak voltage is 1.414 times the rms value; hence the ·average output voltage is 1.414 x 0.826, or 1.17 times the rms voltage.) Equivalently, the rms voltage across each leg (Es) of the secondary need only be 1/1.17 or 0.855 times the average desired dc output voltage.</p>
