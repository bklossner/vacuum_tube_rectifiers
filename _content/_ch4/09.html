    <li>What is meant by the fundamental ripple frequency and the harmonics; what is their relationship to each other?</li>
    <li>Draw a capacitor- filter circuit, explain its action and describe its advantages and disadvantages.</li>
    <li>Explain the action of an inductance filter and compare it with a capacitance filter.</li>
    <li>Why is a capacitor-input filter better than a single shunt capacitor? What is the maximum DC output voltage of the filter and how does it vary with increasing load current?</li>
    <li>What is a bleeder resistor and why is it necessary in the output of a capacitance-type filter? What are its other advantages in conjunction with any type of filter?</li>
    <li>Compare the operation of a choke-input filter with that of a capacitor-input filter. State which filter has better voltage regulation? lower ripple voltage? higher DC output voltage? For which application is each filter best suited?</li>
    <li>What is meant by the minimum input inductance of a choke-input filter? Compute the minimum inductance for a three-phase, full-wave, 60-cycle circuit, if the DC output voltage is 400 volts and the load current is 250 ma.</li>
    <li>Define incremental inductance. How does the variation in incremental inductance of a swinging choke make it useful for choke-input filters?</li>
    <li>When is a resistance-capacitance filter practicable? Compute the ripple reduction factor of an R-C filter, using 25Î¼f shunt capacitors and a 20,000-ohm series resistor, for a 60-cycle, single-phase, half-wave rectifier circuit.</li>
    <li>Design a choke-input filter for a three-phase, full-wave, 60-cycle rectifier, so that the fundamental ripple voltage from the filter output is only 0.1 % of the input ripple. The DC voltage of the rectifier is 300 volts, the output current is 500 ma, and the bleeder current is 50 ma. (Hint: Compute first the minimum input inductance of the filter, then the value of the shunt capacitance.)</li>
    <li>What value capacitance is required to tune the filter in question (IO) to parallel resonance at the fundamental ripple frequency?</li>
