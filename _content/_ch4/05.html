<h3>Choke-Input Filter</h3>

<p>A typical choke-input filter, consisting of a 20-henry series inductor and a 10-microfarad shunt capacitor, is shown in Fig. 24. When the load draws no current, the DC output voltage of the choke-input filter is nearly equal to the peak value of the ac voltage applied to the rectifier, just as in the case of a capacitor-input filter. This is so because in the absence of a load current no voltage drop is developed across the choke coil (L), and hence the output capacitor (C) charges up to the peak value. However, if even small load current is drawn, the DC output voltage drops rapidly to some lower value and then remains fairly constant over a wide range of load-current values. The initial sharp drop occurs because the series inductor prevents the capacitor from charging to the peak voltage when a load current is drawn. After this initial drop there is good voltage regulation of the choke-input filter.</p>

<p>Bleeder Resistor. A bleeder resistor connected across the filter output is generally designed to draw sufficient current for operation in the beginning of the almost constant portion of the voltage-current curve of the filter output, where the voltage regulation is excellent (Fig. 26A). By placing a load across the output, the bleeder becomes useful also in preventing high-voltage surges through the power supply when the equipment is first turned on. For satisfactory operation, the bleeder should draw about 10% of the rated load current.</p>

<p>Waveforms. The voltage and current relations in a choke-input filter are illustrated by the waveforms in Fig. 24. The load current in the choke coil lags behind the rectifier output voltage, as shown, and has a small ripple. The DC output voltage across C and the load is substantially constant, as indicated by the dotted line, and its value is somewhat less than the peak ac voltage, depending on the load current drawn. The ripple in the DC load current through the choke can be considerably reduced by increasing the value of the inductance. For an infinite inductance (the ideal case) the DC load-current waveform becomes a straight line equal to the average of the fluctuations shown in Fig. 24.</p>

<p>Input Inductance Requirements. For normal choke-input filter operation there must be a continuous flow of current through the choke coil. The peak value of the ac ripple current through the choke must be less than the DC output current, or the current through the choke might fall at times to zero. This condition is approximately realized by choosing the value of the input inductance (L) so that the following relation is satisfied:</p>

<p>For the practical case of a 60-cycle, single-phase full-wave rectifier, the fundamental ripple frequency is 120 cycles, the ripple voltage E1=0.667 E (where E is the DC output voltage) and hence the above relation becomes where E is the DC output voltage and I is the output current.</p>

<p>Example: What should be the minimum value of the inductance in a choke-input filter if the output voltage from a full-wave 60-cycle rectifier filter system is 350 volts and the DC load current is 100 ma.?</p>

<p>Solution: The minimum inductance</p>

<p>Actually to assure good operation at low load currents, a larger value than the minimum inductance should be selected.</p>

<p>The minimum inductance given by the above relation is that value below which the choke-input filter is no longer capable of functioning properly, but at which it acts like a capacitor-input system. Note that the minimum inductance depends inversely on the load current. If the load current fluctuates over a certain range, an inductance corresponding to the lowest load-current value must be chosen to obtain satisfactory operation. Here again, a fixed bleeder resistor, drawing about 10% of the full DC output current, assures good voltage regulation and eliminates the need for excessive input inductance values.</p>

<p>In the next chapter we shall consider choke-input filter design in more detail and the minimum inductance values for various rectifier circuits (single- or three-phase) will be given.</p>

<p>Swinging Choke. From the relation given for the minimum input inductance, it is evident that the required inductance may vary over a wide range, depending on the load-current fluctuations. Even with a bleeder present, the required inductance at the minimum (bleeder) current may be excessive compared to the value needed for effective hum suppression at normal load currents. A swinging choke is designed to overcome this disadvantage by varying its inductance according to the load. The inductance of a swinging choke is high at low load currents and drops off with increasing load currents. This is accomplished by making the air-gap of the choke coil very small. At small load currents, the incremental inductance of such a choke will be very high, while at large load currents it will be sufficient to give adequate filtering. (The incremental inductance is the inductance to the alternating ripple current superimposed upon the DC magnetization.)</p>

<p>It is important to realize that the minimum inductance given by the previously stated relation is the incremental inductance, that is, the inductance to the ac ripple superimposed on the dc magnetizing current. As the DC magnetization decreases at low load currents, the incremental inductance of any choke increases. Even without a swinging choke, the relation for minimum inductance at low load currents will generally be satisfied by any well-designed choke coil.</p>
