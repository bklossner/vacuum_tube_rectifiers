<h3>Resistance-Capacitance Filter</h3>

<p>When the load-current requirements are small and a moderate de voltage drop across the filter is permissible, the inductance of a capacitor-input filter may be replaced by a series resistance. The resulting resistance-capacitance (R-C) filter is not as effective as an inductive filter, since the series resistor offers as much impedance to DC as to the ripple voltage. Some ripple is always present. The advantage of the R-C filter is that a resistance is much less expensive than an inductance. An R-C filter with typical component values is shown in Fig. 25.</p>

<p>Capacitance C1 in Fig. 25 is made sufficiently large to present a very low impedance to the ripple frequency, while at the same time offering practically infinite impedance to DC. The ripple voltage, therefore, prefers the shunt path through C1 to minus (and ground), while the DC is forced through resistor (R) and develops a voltage drop across it. Most of the remaining ripple voltage at the filter output is shunted to ground through the low-impedance path offered by capacitor (C2), while the filtered rectifier voltage is available at the output terminals. The value of the filtered DC output voltage is substantially the rectifier output voltage developed across capacitor (C1) minus the voltage drop developed across series resistor R.</p>

<p>Amount of Filtering. In practical R-C filters, the reactance of the shunting capacitors is always made small compared with the series resistance. Under this condition, each section of an R-C filter reduces the ripple voltage applied to its input by the following (approximate) ratio:</p>

<p>When several filter sections are connected in series (cascade), the total reduction factor is approximately equal to the product of the voltage reduction factors of the individual sections. In polyphase rectifiers, where the ripple frequency (f) is high, a single R-C section is usually adequate.</p>

<p>Example: Compute the ripple voltage reduction factor of the R-C filter shown in Fig. 25, for a 60-cycle single-phase, full-wave rectifier.</p>

<p>Hence, the output ripple is only 0.53% of the input ripple.</p>

<p>Uses of R-C Filters. Because of their relatively low expense R-C filters are popular in a wide variety of low-current drain applications including oscilloscope power supplies, and decoupling networks in resistance-coupled amplifiers. In these applications, some voltage drop in the filter is permissible and the current drain is sufficiently low to prevent the voltage drop from becoming excessive. Whenever large load currents are required, however, the high voltage drop developed across the resistance of an R-C filter cannot be tolerated.</p>
