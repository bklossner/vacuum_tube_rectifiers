<h3>Comparison and Design of Capacitor-Input and Choke-Input Filters</h3>

<p>The main electrical difference between choke-input and capacitor-input filters is that current flows continuously from the rectifier to the filter in choke-input circuits, while current flow is an intermittent series of charging pulses in capacitor-input circuits. The consequences of this basic difference are a higher DC output voltage, lower ripple voltage and poorer voltage regulation for a capacitor-input filter than for the choke-input type, when both are used with the same circuit and load. Furthermore, in a capacitor-input filter the ripple voltage increases with increasing load current (i.e., the filtering becomes poorer), while for choke-input filters the ripple voltage is independent of the load current. Finally, the ratio of the peak current to the average de flowing through the rectifier tubes is higher for a capacitor-input filter than for the corresponding choke-input circuit. This results in poor utilization of rectifier tubes and the transformer for capacitor-input filters.</p>

<p>Applications. In general, capacitor-input filters are employed when the amount of required DC power is small. This is the case in most electronic home appliances, radio sets, television receivers, and small public-address systems. Choke-input filters, on the other hand, are used whenever the amount of DC power required is large, because of the savings in tubes and transformer costs resulting from the lower peak currents. For this reason, choke-input filter circuits are exclusively used in polyphase rectifiers and wherever good regulation of the DC voltage is more important than a small increase in its value. Voltage-multiplying circuits always use capacitor-input filters, since the input capacitor is essential to their operation.</p>

<p>Regulation of the D-C Voltage. The regulation of a rectifier-filter system is the decrease in available DC output voltage from no-load current to full-load current. Figure 26 graphically compares the variation in output voltage with load current of a choke-input filter (solid line) with that of a capacitor-input filter (dotted line) in a typical single-phase, full-wave circuit.</p>

<p>It is evident from Fig. 26 that the no-load DC output voltage of both types of filters is almost equal to the rectifier peak output voltage. In both filters the output voltage drops off with increasing dc load current because of unavoidable voltage drops across the transformer windings, rectifier tubes, and filter components. Note, however, that the output voltage with a capacitor-input filter continues to drop off steadily with increasing loads, while the output voltage with a choke-input filter becomes almost constant after an initial sharp drop. The reason for this difference is as follows. In the capacitor filter, the output voltage continues to fall off because of the more rapid discharge of the filter input capacitor with increasing load currents. In the choke-input filter the output voltage drops off sharply with a small increase in load current because the choke coil prevents the shunt capacitor from charging to the peak voltage. After this drop the output voltage falls off only gradually, due to increasing tube and transformer drops. Choke-input filters are, therefore, always operated in the current-voltage region beyond point A (in Fig. 26) by a suitable bleeder resistor placed across the output of the filter.</p>

<p>Curves of the type shown in Fig. 26 permit determination of rectifier output voltage of a particular circuit for various loads and filter component values. Such curves are frequently presented in manufacturer's tube manuals, or the information for them may be listed in tabular form under "typical operating conditions."</p>

<p>L-C Filter Design. Figure 27 shows typical examples of choke-input and capacitor-input filters of one or more sections which are placed between the rectifier output and the load to obtain substantially pure DC.</p>

<p>Note in Fig. 27 that for design purposes each filter section is considered to be made up of a series inductance (choke coil) and a shunt capacitor. The input inductance of a choke-input filter is part of the first filter section, but the shunt capacitance (C) of a capacitor-input filter is included not as part of the first filter section, but as an integral part of the rectifier output. With the input capacitor considered as part of the rectifier, the filter sections of choke-input and capacitor-input circuits become identical. Then rectifier output and ripple voltage that feeds into the series inductance of a choke-input filter or into the shunt capacitance of a capacitor-input filter must be determined. Now it is possible to compute the reduction in the ripple voltage in the same way for both types of filters. As stated before, the rectifier tube output voltages (for typical operating conditions) into either an input inductance or a shunt capacitor are listed in manufacturersâ€¢ tube manuals.</p>

<p>When the reactance of the shunt capacitance of an L-C filter section is small at the lowest ripple frequency compared to the load resistance (or the reactance of th( inductor that follows), which is always the case in practical filters, the reduction is the ripple voltage for a single section may be computed from the following approximate relation:</p>

<p>In the next chapter a number of curves will be presented from which the reduction factor for L-C filters with various rectifier circuits can be determined without elaborate computation.</p>
