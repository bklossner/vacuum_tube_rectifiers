<h3>Voltage-Tripler Circuit</h3>

<p>The cascade voltage doubler can be combined in series with a half-wave rectifier to provide a DC output voltage that is three times the peak of the ac input voltage. A cascade voltage tripler is shown in Fig. 14. The input voltage may be supplied from a transformer or directly from the ac supply line.</p>

<p>Diodes V1 and V2 evidently comprise a half-wave voltage doubler which delivers an output voltage across C2 equal to 2E or twice the peak value (E) of the applied ac input voltage. In addition, half-wave rectifier V3 produces across C3 a voltage equal to the peak value (E) of the applied ac input voltage. The voltages across capacitors C2 and C3 are added in series, and the no-load dc output voltage is three times the peak input voltage. The voltage drops off rapidly when load current is drawn.</p>
