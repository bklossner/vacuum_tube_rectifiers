The Half-Wave Rectifier

A single diode is known as a half-wave rectifier since it permits current to pass only during the positive half-cycle of an applied ac voltage. A half-wave rectifier circuit with its input and output waveforms is shown in Fig. 5. An ac input voltage, usually derived from a power transformer, is applied in series with the diode rectifier and a load resistance. Plate current (Ib) flows through the tube and load every other half-cycle during positive alternations of the input voltage, and is blocked during the negative half-cycles. Although unidirectional, the load current is not dc because of its pulsations in amplitude. It can be shown mathematically that these pulsations contain both a dc component and an ac component, known as ripple. The current can be converted into a steady dc by filtering out the ac ripple with suitable smoothing filters. (See Chap. 4.)

It is evident from Fig. 5 that during the time that plate current flows, its instantaneous magnitude follows exactly the changes in the applied voltage. The shape of the plate-current waveform, therefore, is an exact replica of the ac input voltage waveform during positive half-cycles. The plate current develops a dc output voltage across the load resistance as it flows through it. The waveform (not shown) is exactly the same as that of the ac input voltage, except that only the positive half-cycles are reproduced. Since one-half of the input voltage is lost, the efficiency of the half-wave rectifier is low.

When the plate-current waveform of the half-wave rectifier (Fig. 5) is averaged out over one complete cycle, it is found that the average current ﬂowing through the tube is only 0.318 times the peak amplitude of the current. This means that a line drawn at 0.318 times the height of the peak current amplitude represents the average or steady direct current flowing through the tube. Exactly the same is true for the dc output voltage. The average value of the pulsating dc output voltage is again only 0.318 times the value of the peak voltage appearing across the transformer secondary winding. (This theoretical value neglects the voltage drop in the transformer secondary and the voltage drop lost across the tube.) If the load draws a considerable current, the output voltage drops to an even lower value because of the increased drops across the tube and the transformer secondary.

Example: As a practical example, let us consider the half-wave rectifier circuit shown in Fig. 6, which employs a type 6W4-GT vacuum diode and a step-up power transformer with a 350-volt secondary plate winding. Another secondary, called the filament winding, supplies 6.3 volts ac to the heater of the rectifier tube.

The root-mean-square (rms) value of the applied plate voltage across the transformer secondary must be multiplied by 1.414 to obtain the peak value of the applied ac voltage. We thus obtain 1.414 x 350, or 495 volts peak ac voltage. The average or dc output voltage, however, is only 0.318 times the peak value, or 0.318 x 4952156 volts. If we multiply the two factors together right away, we would see that the dc output voltage is only 0.45 times the rms value of the applied ac voltage (i.e., 1.414 x 031820.45) Equivalently, the rms value of the applied ac voltage must be 1/0.45, or 2.22 times the value of the desired dc output voltage. The dc output voltage of 156 volts in Fig. 6 represents a theoretical or maximum value. In practice, the voltage will be considerably lower because of the tube voltage drop and the voltage lost in the transformer secondary winding which we have neglected. More-over, when considerable load current is drawn, these voltage drops will increase and subtract still more from the available dc output voltage. However, the no-load dc output voltage of the circuit in Fig. 6 may actually rise above the rms value of the applied ac voltage when a suitable filter is connected across the output of the rectifier. This is because most filters employ capacitors that charge up to the peak value of the output-voltage pulsations and substantially maintain this value when the plate current drops to zero during negative half-cycles. The poor regulation of the circuit will not maintain a high output voltage when large load currents are drawn through the tube.

Limitations and Uses. We have already seen that a half-wave rectifier makes poor use of the ac supply, since it delivers power only half the time, during positive alternations of the supply voltage. As a result the ratio of the peak currents and voltages to the average current is high, the efficiency low, and the regulation poor. Half-wave rectifiers are not used, therefore, when more than a few-milliamperes load current is required. They are suitable for applications requiring a small current drain, such as accelerating anode (ultor voltage) supply of oscilloscopes and TV picture tubes. Perhaps the largest application of half-wave rectifiers is for the power supplies of ac-dc radios. Probably better than 90% of the radios made today use half-wave rectifiers because the current drain is relatively low and the 60-cycle response is very poor. Therefore, the 60-cycle hum voltage is not very troublesome.

Another disadvantage of half—wave rectifiers is that the output current pulsates at the same frequency as the ac power line. Elaborate filter circuits are required to eliminate this low-frequency ripple and produce smooth direct current. Finally, note in Figs. 5 and 6 that the rectified output current flows through the secondary winding of the power transformer. This results in a dc magnetization which saturates the core of the power transformer. The efficiency of the transformer is considerably reduced and its expense goes up. The full-wave and other rectifier circuits, to be discussed next, avoid saturating the core of the power transformer by balancing out the dc magnetization with opposing currents.
