<h3>The Full-Wave Bridge Rectifier</h3>

<p>The need for a center-tapped power transformer is eliminated by the bridge rectifier, in which four diodes are used (Fig. 10). As illustrated, the input to the bridge circuit is applied to diagonally opposite corners of the network, while the output to the load is taken from the remaining two corners. The circuit is a full-wave type, since both halves of the ac input cycle are utilized. Two tubes in series carry the load current on alternate half-cycles. The bridge circuit now makes maximum use of the power supply.</p>

<p>Operation. Assume that the polarities are such that the top of the transformer secondary winding is initially positive during the first half-cycle (A) of the ac supply voltage. During this half-cycle the transformer secondary voltage may be considered to be applied across a series circuit, consisting of rectifier tube Vl, the load resistor, and tube V2. Since the cathode of V1 is at maximum negative potential and the plate of V2 at maximum positive potential, an electron current flows through V1, the load resistor V2, and the transformer secondary, in the direction indicated by the solid arrows. During this first half-cycle the plates of tubes V3 and V4 are more negative than their cathodes and, hence, these do not conduct. Thus, the half-cycle (A) is reproduced by the conducting tubes V1 and V2 and across the load resistor, as illustrated by the waveforms (A) in Fig. 10.</p>

<p>One half-cycle (B) later, the top of the transformer secondary is negative and the bottom is positive, so that tubes V1 and V2 cannot conduct. However, the plates of V3 and V4 are now positive with respect to their cathodes and an electron current flows through V3, the load resistor, and the transformer secondary, in the direction indicated by the dotted arrows. Thus, the second half-cycle (B) of the supply voltage is reproduced by conducting tubes V3 and V4 and across the load resistor, as shown by the wave- forms (N) in Fig. 10. Note that the current pulses (A and B) ï¬‚ow through the load resistor in the same direction during both half- cycles, each pulse flowing from the V1-V3 plate junction toward the V2-V4 cathode junction of the load resistor. This makes the plate-end of the load resistor negative and the cathode-end positive, since electron current flows from minus to plus. The current pulses thus are unidirectional and their ripple frequency is twice that of the ac supply frequency, just as for the conventional full-wave rectifier circuit.</p>

<p>Advantages and Limitations. One advantage of the bridge rectifier over the conventional full-wave rectifier is that the bridge circuit produces a voltage output nearly twice that of the full-wave circuit for a given power transformer. In the full-wave rectifier the transformer secondary voltage is split and only one-half of the total is applied to the conducting tube. In the bridge circuit, however, the full voltage of the secondary winding is applied across the two conducting tubes during each half-cycle. Therefore, the voltage developed across the load resistor is twice that of a conventional full-wave circuit less the voltage drop wasted across the two conducting tubes. The average dc output voltage of the bridge rectifier is 0.9 times the rms value of the full transformer secondary voltage, compared to 0.9 times the rms value of half, the secondary Voltage (one side of center-tap) for the ordinary full-wave rectifier. It is clear that the bridge rectifier makes better use of the transformer than the full-wave rectifier circuit.</p>

<p>A second advantage of the bridge circuit is that the inverse voltage impressed across each (nonconducting) tube is only half that applied across each tube of a full-wave rectifier. This is evident from the circuit diagram (Fig. 10) inasmuch as two tubes in series divide the transformer secondary voltage between them. The inverse voltage rating of tubes used in bridge rectifiers need be only half of that required for conventional full-wave rectifier tubes. Hence the bridge rectifier is popular for high-voltage work.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of the bridge circuit is that four tubes are required, which makes the operation somewhat uneconomical. (As we shall see in a moment, two tubes cannot be combined in one envelope because the cathodes are not at the same potential and therefore cannot be connected in parallel.)</p>

<p>More detrimental to the utility of bridge rectifiers is the fact that the cathodes (or filaments) of the tubes are not at the same potential. An analysis of Fig. 10 shows that the cathodes of V2 and V4 are at the same voltage, since they are connected together, but the cathodes of V1 and V3 are at different potentials, both with respect to each other and also to the cathode of V2 or V4. The bridge circuit requires three separate filament transformers (or secondary windings) which must be well insulated from each other and from the ground connection. This makes use of the circuit a rarely exercised luxury. This is true in tubes with directly heated cathodes, but the obstacle is overcome in tubes with indirectly heated cathodes such as used with the 6X4.</p>

<p>The last disadvantage cited does not apply to diodes not requiring cathode heating power, such as metallic-oxide rectifiers and crystal diodes. The bridge circuit is therefore widely used with selenium, copper-oxide, and crystal rectifiers.</p>
