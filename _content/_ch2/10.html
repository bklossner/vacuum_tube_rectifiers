Review Questions

(1) Draw the circuit of a half-wave rectifier and explain its operation. Assign a typical value to the ac input voltage and compute the DC output voltage.

(2) Explain the advantages of a full-wave rectifier over that of the half-wave type. What is the ratio of the average to the peak current or voltage? The rms voltage to the DC output voltage?

(3) Define the following terms: regulation; ripple frequency; dc magnetization of core; step-up ratio; rms, peak, and average values of voltage and current; no-load current.

(4) Using a tube manual, select a full-wave rectifier tube, assign a value to the transformer secondary voltage and compute the no-load dc output voltage.

(5) Explain the operation of a bridge-type rectifier and state its advantages and disadvantages.

(6) What is the ratio of the average DC output voltage to the rms value of the transformer secondary voltage in a bridge rectifier circuit?

(7) Why are bridge circuits using metallic-oxide rectifiers and crystal diodes popular?

(8) What is the basic, principle of voltage-multiplying circuits?
