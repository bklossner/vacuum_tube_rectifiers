<h3>Triode Rectifiers</h3>

<p>Grid-controlled tubes, or triodes, are sometimes used as rectifiers. The use of the grid permits regulating the power delivered to the load by controlling the time during which the current flows during each cycle. The tubes used for this purpose are almost exclusively gas-filled types called thyratrons. Since this volume is primarily concerned with vacuum tubes, thyratron rectifiers will not be covered here.</p>
