29. Capacitor-Input Filter

More effective filtering action can be attained by combining the actions of a shunt capacitor and a series inductor in capacitance-inductance filters. Various combinations of such filters exist, but in all of them the action of the capacitors is to resist changes in output voltage by charging and discharging, as required, while the inductors oppose any changes in the magnitude of the load current through the action of their associated magnetic field. Equivalently, the shunt capacitors may be considered to form a low impedance path to minus, and ground for the ripple voltage, and an essentially infinite impedance to de. The series inductors (choke coils) can be considered to offer a low impedance to the passage of DC and a very high impedance to the ripple current.

Figure 23 illustrates a capacitor-input filter (also known as a pi-filter) with typical component values. This circuit is characterized by a high output voltage at low current drain, the voltage being almost equal to the peak value of the transformer secondary voltage applied to each tube. (The peak value is 1.414 times the
