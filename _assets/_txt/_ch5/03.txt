Filter Design Data

Some of the critical design factors determining filter operation have been discussed in Chap. 4 and formulas have been given for computing the reduction in ripple voltage for different filter sections. These various factors and relations are summarized in the filter design chart of Table II, which gives the minimum inductance for choke-input filters and the L-C product values for both choke-input and capacitor-input filters.

Note that Table II gives L-C values for both 50-cycle and 60- cycle supply sources. The 50-cycle ac supplies are common in many countries. The horizontal axis at the bottom of the chart lists the rms ripple voltage (of both fundamental and harmonic components) as a percentage of the DC output voltage. The horizontal scale at the top of the chart gives the ripple voltage in db (decibels) with reference to the DC output voltage. Decibels are frequently used to express a relative voltage ratio and the db values may be found from the relation db = 20 Iog10 Eif E0 , where EifE 0 is the voltage ratio to be expressed in db.

For example, the value of 10% ripple in the chart corresponds to -20 db, since for a voltage ratio EifE 0 of 0.1 (10%),

Similarly, for a ripple of 0.5%, the voltage ratio E1/E0 is 0.005 or I /200, and hence

The chart, therefore, shows a value of -46 db corresponding to a ripple of 0.5%. Negative db values are usually spoken of as being so many below the reference voltage. Thus a ripple of 0.5% is referred to as being 46 db below the DC output voltage.

Choke-Input Design Procedure. To design a choke-input filter by means of the chart, assume a plausible minimum value for the input inductance. Then determine from the manufacturer's tube manuals or by calculation, the actual value of the DC output voltage into this input inductance for the particular circuit and desired operating values. A check with the minimum-inductance formula L = KE/If* will then reveal whether the assumed inductance value is adequate, or possibly even excessive. If the load current requirements of the circuit vary over a range, the minimum load current (or bleeder current) should be substituted for I in the minimum inductance formula. Finally, the L-C product for the desired ripple reduction and circuit is determined from the chart, and the value of the shunt capacitance is computed by dividing it into the L-C product. Depending on requirements, a different order may be followed in the procedure.

*Note that E in this case is the DC output voltage, not fundamental component of ripple voltage as shown in the equation on page 46.

Capacitor-Input Design Procedure. For a capacitor-input filter, it is advisable to determine first the required value of the input (shunt) capacitor for the desired rectifier output voltage. This information is usually given in manufacturers' tube manuals, or it may be calculated. The L-C product for the desired minimum ripple voltage is then determined from the chart for the circuit and supply frequency used. Finally, the value of the series inductance is determined by dividing the L-C product by the value of the shunt capacitance (C). If several filter sections are needed, the L-C product is ascertained from the proper curve in the chart. The same values are used for the series inductance and shunt capacitance of each section.

R-C Filters. A simple formula .has been given in Chap. 4 for determining the ripple reduction factor of an R-C filter in terms of the component values (R and C) and the ripple frequency (f). This formula is easy to use for one or more R-C sections and makes it unnecessary to provide an additional design chart for R-C filters.
