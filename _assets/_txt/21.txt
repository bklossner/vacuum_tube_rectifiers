half-cycle, (A), of the ac supply voltage. The plate of V1 is therefore positive with respect to the cathode junction. A plate current (Ib1) ﬂows from the cathode to the plate of V1, through the top half of the transformer secondary, and through the load, in the direction indicated by the top arrows. This current develops a voltage across the load, indicated by the half-cycle (A) in the output voltage waveform (Fig. 7). The direction of the current makes the cathode-end of the load positive. (Electron current ﬂows from minus to plus.)

Note that during this first half-cycle (A) of the input voltage, the bottom of the transformer secondary is negative with respect
