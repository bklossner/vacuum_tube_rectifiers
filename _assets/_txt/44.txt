that full-wave rectification of both ac half-cycles is obtained from each phase. The waveform of the output voltage, shown at right in Fig. 20, is essentially the same as that of the double-wye circuit (Fig. 18), where the ripple-frequency of the output is six times that of the three-phase ac supply.

No balance coil is required, but the power transformer must have three secondary windings and the filament transformer must have four separate secondary windings, one for V1, V2, and V3, and one each for V4, V5, and V6. Since the rectified tube currents flow in opposing directions through the secondaries, no DC magnetization can take place. Three single-phase transformers may be used in place of one three-phase transformer.

As in the delta-star circuit, the average DC load current is 0.955 times the peak current through each tube, but one-third of the de load current flows through each tube (rather than one-sixth, as in the delta-star circuit), because two tubes are required for each output current pulse. As pointed out before, the average DC output voltage is twice that of the three-phase half-wave rectifier, or 2 x 1.17 = 2.34 times the rms value of the ac voltage across each secondary leg. Conversely, the rms voltage across each leg need
