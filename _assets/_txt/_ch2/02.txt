The Full-Wave Rectifier

Plate current can be made to ﬂow during the full cycle of the ac supply voltage by the use of two diode half-wave rectifiers in a full-wave rectifier circuit (Fig. 7). The tubes alternately supply rectified current to the load during both halves of the ac input voltage in such a way that the load current always flOWs in the same direction.

Note in Fig. 7 that the cathodes of the two rectifier tubes are tied together and the common junction is connected to one side of the load resistor. The other end of the load is connected to the center-tap (C) of the secondary winding of the power transformer. (Two separate windings can be used instead of a single center-tapped winding.) Only one-half of the transformer secondary voltage appears between plate and cathode of each rectifier tube since each tube is connected between one end of the winding and a point midway in voltage (the center-tap). This means that the transformer secondary winding must supply a plate-to-plate voltage that is twice the value of the plate voltage required for each tube. To provide sufficient plate and output voltage, the transformer usually has a considerable step-up ratio between primary and secondary winding.

When an ac voltage is applied to the primary winding of the transformer, a voltage of the same shape (shown in Fig. 7), but enlarged in amplitude appears across the secondary winding. This secondary voltage is split in half, one-half appearing across V1 in series with the load, the other half appearing across V2 in series with the load. Assume that the polarities cause the top of the transformer secondary to be initially positive during the first half-cycle, (A), of the ac supply voltage. The plate of V1 is therefore positive with respect to the cathode junction. A plate current (Ib1) flows from the cathode to the plate of V1, through the top half of the transformer secondary, and through the load, in the direction indicated by the top arrows. This current develops a voltage across the load, indicated by the half-cycle (A) in the output voltage waveform (Fig. 7). The direction of the current makes the cathode-end of the load positive. (Electron current flows from minus to plus.)

Note that during this first half-cycle (A) of the input voltage, the bottom of the transformer secondary is negative with respect to the center-tap, hence the plate of V2 is negative. No plate current flows through V2 during this half-cycle.

During the second half-cycle (B) of the ac input voltage the top of the transformer secondary will be negative with respect to the center-tap. The plate of V1 is negative with respect to its cathode and no plate current flows. This is indicated by the dotted line for the negative half-cycle of Ib1. During this same half-cycle, the bottom of the secondary winding is positive as is the plate of V2 with respect to the cathode junction. Consequently a plate current (Ib2) flows from the cathode to the plate of V2, then through the bottom half of the transformer secondary and through the load, in the direction indicated by the bottom arrows. It is evident that the current flows in the same direction through the load as it did during the previous half-cycle. Thus two positive half-cycles (A and B) appear across the load during one ac cycle of the input voltage.

During succeeding half-cycles (A and B) of the input voltage, V1 and V2 continue to conduct alternately, each permitting current to ﬂow during the half-cycle where its plate is positive with respect to the cathode junction. Since there are two output pulses for each complete cycle of the input voltage, the current through the load is a series of unidirectional pulses which have a frequency twice that of the ac supply frequency. With the ripple frequency twice that of the ac input voltage and the current much less discontinuous than that of the half-wave rectifier, the pulsations are easily smoothed out by a suitable filter circuit. Furthermore, the efficiency of the full-wave rectifier is far greater than that of the half-wave type.

Since there are two output pulses for each ac cycle, compared to only one in the half-wave rectifier, the average current value of the full-wave rectifier is twice that of the half-wave rectifier, or 0.636 times the peak current value. Similarly, the average of the output voltage is twice that of the half-wave rectifier for the same input, or 0.636 times the peak voltage value. Since the peak voltage is 1.414 times the rms voltage across the transformer secondary, the average output voltage is 1.414 x 0.636, or 0.9 times the rms value of the secondary voltage (across one-half of the winding). Equivalently, the rms voltage across one-half of the transformer secondary must be 1/0.9 or 1.1 times the desired average value of the output voltage, or only one-half that required for a half—wave rectifier. (Across the entire secondary the value is the same as for a half-wave rectifier.)

Note in Fig. 7 that when V1 is conducting, its cathode is at a positive potential almost equal to the peak value of the transformer secondary voltage (except for the tube drop). The cathode of (nonconducting) V2, therefore, is at the same high positive potential, while at the same time its plate is at a high negative potential equal to the peak value of the transformer secondary voltage. The same is true when V2 is conducting and V1 is nonconducting. The rectifier tube used in a full-wave circuit must therefore be able to withstand an inverse voltage of almost twice the peak of the secondary voltage applied to each tube separately.

Example:

Let us compare the practical full-wave rectifier circuit shown in Fig. 8 with the half-wave rectifier illustrated in Fig. 6. A type 5Y3-G duplex diode (combining two diodes in one envelope) is used in connection with a center-tapped step-up transformer. The transformer secondary supplies 350 volts to each plate, or a total of 700 volts, plate-to-plate. A separate 5-volt secondary winding supplies the filament of the tube. The center-tapped heater winding is the ideal circuit, but many manufacturers dispense with the center-tap (for cost reasons) and B+ is taken directly from one side of the heater.

The (theoretical) average value of the dc output voltage is 0.9 times the rms value of the plate voltage, or 0.9 x 350 = 315 volts. This is about twice the average dc voltage obtained in the half-wave rectifier for the same rms plate voltage. (For two tubes the plate<to.plate voltage is 700 volts, or double the value required for the half-wave rectifier circuit.) The theoretical value of 315 volts is not realized in practice because of the voltage drops across the tube and transformer secondary. Tube manuals list an actual value of 270 volts average dc output voltage (into a choke-input filter) for a load current of 75 ma. When the load current is increased to its maximum value of 150 ma, the regulation of the circuit (additional tube and transformer drops) reduces the available output voltage by another 25 volts, or to about 245 volts. This is still higher than the output voltage obtained for the half-wave rectifier circuit. Also, the current drain permissible for the full-wave circuit is far higher than that of the equivalent half-wave circuit.

Advantages and Uses. Although we have neglected to mention it thus far, you may have noted in Fig. 7 that the individual tube currents of the full-wave rectifier ﬂow in opposite directions through the secondary winding of the power transformer. This avoids the dc magnetization and resultant saturation of the transformer core, one of the serious defects of the half-wave circuit. This advantage, combined with the high-efficiency high-permissible current drain, less ripple (at twice the ac frequency), and relatively high dc output voltage, makes the full-wave rectifier circuit suitable for a wide variety of applications in electronics. It is the standard circuit for low-power applications.

A slight variation (Fig. 9) in conventional rectifier circuits is found in the use of rectifier tubes having an indirectly heated cathode. When using such a tube as the 6X5-GT, it is unnecessary to have a separate filament or heater winding. The heater of this tube is supplied directly from the same heater winding that feeds the other tubes in the associated circuitry.
