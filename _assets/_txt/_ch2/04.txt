Voltage-Multiplying Circuits

Diode rectifiers can be made to deliver dc voltages that are twice or several times the peak amplitude of the alternating voltage supplied to the tubes. This is generally done by charging capacitors (through rectifiers on alternate ac half-cycles) with polarities that cause the dc voltages developed to add in series. Voltage multipliers are especially useful in highâ€”voltage circuits where it is inconvenient to employ a transformer with a sufficiently high secondary voltage, and in transformerless receiver circuits operated directly from the ll7-volt ac source. The following paragraphs describe several circuits frequently used for such purposes.
