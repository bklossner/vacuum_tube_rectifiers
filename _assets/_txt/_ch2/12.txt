Full-Wave Voltage Doubler

The full-wave voltage doubler shown in Fig. 11 is capable of delivering a dc output voltage that is twice the peak voltage of the applied alternating voltage. Basically, the circuit is so arranged that the output voltages of the two half-wave rectifiers (V1 and V2) are in series. It is a full-wave doubler because the rectifier tubes pass current to the load on each half of the input ac cycle.

The action of the full-wave doubler is as follows. When the top of the transformer secondary winding is instantaneously positive [during positive half-cycle (A)], diode V1 passes a current in the direction of the solid arrows, which charges up capacitor C1 so that its upper plate becomes positive. (You can see that the upper plate becomes positively charged since electrons ﬂow out from it to the cathode of V1 leaving an excessive positive charge, while electrons from the plate of V1 and the transformer secondary flow into the lower plate of Cl giving it an excess negative charge.) Capacitor C1 becomes positively charged to the peak value (+E) of the transformer secondary voltage. This is shown in Fig. 11 by the brief charging pulse (A) flowing through rectifier Vl during the first half-cycle.

During the next ac half-cycle (B) the top of the transformer secondary is negative and tube V1 does not conduct. Since the tube is an open circuit, the charge and voltage on capacitor C1 remains essentially constant, except for a small amount that leaks through the load resistance. This is shown in Fig. 11 by the slow dropping off of the dc output voltage. During half-cycle (B) the cathode of V2 becomes negative with respect to its plate. Diode V2 passes a current in the direction of the dotted arrows, which charges up capacitor C2 negatively to the peak value (—E) of the transformer secondary voltage. The brief charging pulse flowing through V2 is shown by current waveform (B) in Fig. 11. With a peak voltage (EA) on capacitor C1 and a peak voltage (EB) on capacitor C2, the total dc output voltage taken across the two capacitors is 2E. Thus the full-wave doubler supplies a no-load dc output voltage twice the peak of the transformer secondary voltage. This theoretical value is attained only when no load current is drawn from the output of the circuit.

When a dc load current is drawn, the output voltage drops below 2E by an amount that depends on the magnitude of the load current and the value of the capacitors. It is evident that the energy delivered to the load must come from discharging capacitors C1 and C2 during the time that the diodes are not replenishing the charge (i.e., during alternate half-cycles). If a large load current is drawn, the diodes cannot replenish the charge as fast as it is used and the voltage across Cl and C2 falls greatly. If the capacitors are made sufficiently large (more than 10 microfarads) a fairly large load current can be supplied for short intervals with reasonably good regulation. Large capacitors draw very high peak currents that may damage the diodes, unless protective resistors are placed in series with the tubes.

In general, the poor voltage regulation of the voltage doubler limits it to applications where the average load-current drain is small. This does not mean that relatively large currents cannot be drawn for a few microseconds, as in pulse-circuit applications.
