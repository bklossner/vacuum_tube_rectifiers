practice, the current magnitude is limited, of course, by the internal resistance of the power source and the resistance of the load circuit.

Thermionic Vacuum Diode. The Ib-Eb characteristic of a thermionic vacuum diode is shown in Fig. 2. Such a diode consists of a directly heated cathode (emitter) and a plate or anode (collector), both enclosed in a highly evacuated glass or metal envelope. When the cathode is heated to its proper operating temperature it emits from its surface a copious supply of electrons which form a negative space charge between cathode and plate. When a potential (Eb) is placed on the plate that is positive with respect to the cathode, electrons are attracted away from the space charge and travel toward the plate as a plate current (Ib). The higher the value of the positive plate voltage, the greater is the ﬂow of plate current through the tube. At each plate voltage value, the total plate current that ﬂows is limited by the. amount of the negative space charge present. When the positive plate potential is made very high, however, a point is reached where the entire space charge is attracted toward the plate and electrons reach the plate in the same proportion as when they were emitted. The plate current then levels off and emission saturation takes place. Further increases in the positive plate voltage cannot cause an increase in the plate current since the entire supply emitted by the cathode is already being drawn to the plate. In practice, thermionic diodes are always operated in the space charge-limiting region to avoid damage to the cathode and to keep tube voltage drop (Eb) at a reasonable value.
