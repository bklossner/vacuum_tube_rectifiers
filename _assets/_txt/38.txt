voltage, therefore, fluctuates at three times the ac supply frequency, as shown in the waveform of Fig. 16. This permits easy filtering of the ripple.

Although each of the rectifier tubes is only a half-wave unit, the cathode currents of all the tubes flow through the common load resistance, so the average DC load current is much higher relative to the peak current than in a single-phase rectifier. The average DC current of a three-phase half-wave rectifier is 0.826 times the peak current, compared to a value of 0.318 for the same ratio in the single-phase, half-wave circuit, and 0.636 for the single-phase, full-wave circuit. Because of this high average current value, the DC output voltage is correspondingly high, and as a matter of fact, it is greater than the ac rms voltage of each secondary leg by a factor of 1.17. (The peak voltage is 1.414 times the rms value; hence the Â·average output voltage is 1.414 x 0.826, or 1.17 times the rms voltage.) Equivalently, the rms voltage across each leg (Es) of the secondary need only be 1/1.17 or 0.855 times the average desired dc output voltage.

20. Three-Phase Half-Wave Delta-Zig-Zag Rectifier

The circuit shown in Fig. 17, known as a three-phase half-wave delta-zig-zag rectifier, because of its configuration, is identical with the delta-wye rectifier except for the method of installing and
