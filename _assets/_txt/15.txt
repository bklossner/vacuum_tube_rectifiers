dc output voltage, that is, the value of the dc output voltage for varying load currents. As we have seen, the low, constant tube drop of mercury-vapor tubes provides the advantage of wasting little voltage across the tube, and of keeping the regulation for varying load currents to a minimum change.

Actual design ratings and other data useful for various representative types of high-vacuum and gas-filled diodes are listed in Chap. 5, Table I.
