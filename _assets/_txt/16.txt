6. Diode Rectifier Circuits

The type of circuit in which diode rectifier tubes are used determines the attainable dc output and voltages, the smoothness of the dc, the amount of filtering required, and other important factors. Rectifier circuits may be classified as either single-phase or polyphase, depending on whether the ac power has one or more phases.

Single-phase circuits are used primarily for the relatively small plate-power requirements of various electronic devices; radio and television sets, public address systems. In contrast, polyphase rectifier circuits are used for high-power requirements demanding economical operation. The capabilities of power transformers and tubes are more fully utilized in polyphase circuits. They have the additional advantage of delivering a dc output that is smoother and requires less filtering than the dc of single-phase circuits.
