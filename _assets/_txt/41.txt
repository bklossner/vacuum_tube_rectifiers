Note that the circuit of Fig. 18 requires six rectifier tubes, each acting as a half-wave rectifier for one phase, or one leg of each wye. The central junction of each wye is connected to the other through the interphase balance winding, which compensates for any inequalities in the upper and lower sections. The centertap of this winding becomes the negative terminal of the DC output voltage. The plates of the rectifier tubes are connected to the legs of the two wyes, while their cathodes are connected together. Consequently, the cathode currents of all tubes flow through the common load resistance.

Examine the secondary wye and output voltage waveforms of the double-wye circuit (Fig. 18). As explained before, the secondary voltage of the first wye (dotted line) is at a minimum when the secondary voltage of the second wye (solid line) is at maximum, and vice versa. The same holds true for the rectified output voltages of each wye, since the half-wave rectifiers simply cut off the negative half-cycles, but do not change the relative
