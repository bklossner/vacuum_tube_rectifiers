Solution: (Refer to Fig. 30.) From Table I, the peak inverse voltage on the rectifier tube will be 3.14 x 430 = 1,350 volts, and the peak plate current is 1.57 x 225 = 354 ma.

From Table III it is apparent that a 5U4-G full-wave rectifier tube will easily and economically meet these requirements.

Referring to the manufacturer's receiving tube manual, it is seen that either a choke-input or capacitor-input filter will be able to supply the required DC output voltage and current, but a choke-input filter. will necessitate a plate-to-plate transformer secondary voltage of l 100 volts (550 volts each leg), while the capacitor-input filter requires only 900 volts secondary plate-to-plate voltage. A capacitor-input filter will thus permit the use of a less expensive power transformer, although its voltage regulation will be poorer than that of the choke-input type. Choosing a capacitorinput filter for economy, we see from the tube manual that an input capacitor of 10 microfarads will give a DC output voltage of 430 volts into the filter at the desired load current of 225 ma (112.5 ma per plate). The tube manual also states that the regulation from half load to full load (112.5 ma to 225 ma) is 80 volts.

To design the filter, refer to Table II, which gives for one section an L-C product of about 83 for a ripple voltage of 11% of the output (or 4.3 volts ac). Since the input capacitor is 10 microfarads; the minimum series inductance of the section should be 83 / 10 or 8.3 henrys. A practical value of 9 henrys will be more than sufficient. Allowing about a 25-volt drop in the choke, the output voltage from the filter will be 405 volts at full load.

A bleeder resistor drawing about IO% of the load, or about 20 ma, should be connected across the filter output. By Ohms Law its resistance should be 430/.02 = 21,500 ohms and its wattage rating must be more than 430 x .02 = 8.6 watts. For safety, a rating of 15 to 20 watts should be selected.

The DC output power of the rectifier is the product of output voltage and full load current or 430 x 0.225 = 97 watts (approximately). Adding about 15% or 15 watts to take care of bleeder requirements, tube and transformer drops, the total DC power is about 112 watts. The kva rating from Table I is 1.1 I times the de output power or 1.11 x 1112 = 125 kilovolt-amperes. In practice, a transformer with a rating of about 135 to 150 kva should be chosen.

Example 2: It is desired to design a 60-cycle, three-phase, half-wave rectifierfilter circuit capable of delivering a DC output of 3,500 volts at 3 amperes maximum load current, and with a ripple not exceeding 0.5% of the output voltage.
