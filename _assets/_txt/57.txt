good regulation of the DC voltage is more important than a small
increase in its value. Voltage-multiplying circuits always use
capacitor-input filters, since the input capacitor is essential to their
operation.

Regulation of the D-C Voltage. The regulation of a rectifier-filter
system is the decrease in available DC output voltage from no-load
current to full-load current. Figure 26 graphically compares the
variation in output voltage with load current of a choke-input
filter (solid line) with that of a capacitor-input filter (dotted line)
in a typical single-phase, full-wave circuit.

It is evident from Fig. 26 that the no-load DC output voltage
of both types of filters is almost equal to the rectifier peak output
voltage. In both filters the output voltage drops off with increasing dc load current because of unavoidable voltage drops across the
transformer windings, rectifier tubes, and filter components. Note,
however, that the output voltage with a capacitor-input filter continues
to drop off steadily with increasing loads, while the output
voltage with a choke-input filter becomes almost constant after an
initial sharp drop. The reason for this difference is as follows.
In the capacitor filter, the output voltage continues to fall off
because of the more rapid discharge of the filter input capacitor
with increasing load currents. In the choke-input filter the output
voltage drops off sharply with a small increase in load current
because the choke coil prevents the shunt capacitor from charging
to the peak voltage. After this drop the output voltage falls off
only gradually, due to increasing tube and transformer drops.
Choke-input filters are, therefore, always operated in the current-voltage
region beyond point A (in Fig. 26) by a suitable bleeder
resistor placed across the output of the filter.
