positive potential almost equal to the peak value of the transformer secondary voltage (except for the tube drop). The cathode of (nonconducting) V2, therefore, is at the same high positive po- tential, while at the same time its plate is at a high negative potential equal to the peak value of the transformer secondary voltage. The same is true when V2 is conducting and V1 is nonconducting. The rectifier tube used in a full-wave circuit must therefore be able to withstand an inverse voltage of almost twice the peak of the secondary voltage applied to each tube separately.

Example:

Let us compare the practical full-wave rectifier circuit shown in Fig. 8 with the half-wave rectifier illustrated in Fig. 6. A type 5Y3-G duplex diode (combining two diodes in one envelope) is used in connection with a centertapped step-up transformer. The transformer secondary supplies 350 volts to each plate, or a total of 700 volts, plate-to-plate. A separate 5-volt secondary winding supplies the filament of the tube. The centertapped heater winding is the ideal circuit, but many manufacturers dispense with the centertap (for cost reasons) and B+ is taken directly from one side of the heater.

The (theoretical) average value of the dc output voltage is 0.9 times the rms value of the plate voltage, or 0.9 x 3502315 volts. This is about twice the average dc voltage obtained in the half-wave rectifier for the same rms plate voltage. (For two tubes the plate<to.plate voltage is 700 volts, or double the value required for the half-wave rectifier circuit.) The theoretical value of 315 volts is not realized in practice because of the voltage drops across the tube and transformer secondary. Tube manuals list an actual value of 270 volts average dc output voltage (into a choke-input filter) for a load current of 75 ma. When the load current is increased to its maximum value of 150 ma, the regulation of the
