wave circuits in parallel through a balance coil (also known as interphase reactor). This results in reversing the polarities of corresponding secondary windings in the lower wye with respect to those in the upper wye. Thus, when the secondary voltage (Es) of one winding in the upper wye is at maximum, the voltage of the corresponding winding in the lower wye will be at a minimum. This effectively adds three extra phases, making a total of six phases.
