mounting the coils in the three-phase transformer. In the delta-wye circuit (Fig. 16) the rectified current flows through each secondary coil in one direction, which saturates the transformer core and effectively reduces the inductance of the winding, just as in the single-phase half-wave rectifier. This disadvantage is overcome in the delta-zig-zag circuit by supplying each core with two secondary windings operating in phase opposition to each other. As a consequence, each leg is made up of two sections, each operating in a different magnetic circuit. These are connected in successive legs of a zig-zag arrangement to give secondary voltages phased 120° apart. Each secondary phase (Es) then turns out to be the vector sum of two winding voltages that are effectively 60° out of phase with each other. It may be shown* that Es equals the square-root of 3 or 1.732 times the voltage developed across each coil winding.

21. Three-Phase Half-Wave Double-Wye (Six-Phase) Rectifier

What essentially amounts to six-phase operation is obtained in the circuit shown in Fig. 18 by connecting two three-phase half-
