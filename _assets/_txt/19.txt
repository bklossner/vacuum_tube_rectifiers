for applications requiring a small current drain, such as accelerating anode (ultor voltage) supply of oscilloscopes and TV picture tubes. Perhaps the largest application of half-wave rectifiers is for the power supplies of ac-dc radios. Probably better than 90% of the radios made today use half-wave rectifiers because the current drain is relatively low and the 60-cycle response is very poor. Therefore, the 60-cycle hum voltage is not very troublesome.
