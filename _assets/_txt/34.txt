4 x 1.414 or about 5.65 times the rms value of the ac source voltage, two quadruplers in series should produce an output voltage approximately 11 times the rms value of the ac input voltage. For a 117-volt ac line, this would result in a DC output voltage of about 1,300 volts, which would be nice work if you could get it.

In practice, however, it is found that the quadrupler presents a technical and economical limit of attainable voltage multiplication. As it attempts to increase the multiplication, the regulation of the system becomes progressively, poorer, so that the attained output voltage drops off rapidly with even small load-current increases. The voltage stress across the series capacitors becomes increasingly great, requiring expensive units with high voltage ratings. Also, since the peak current through the rectifier must be limited to the rated values, the possible load current that can be supplied by the tubes becomes less with increasing multiplication. Finally, the cathodes of the tubes must be well isolated from each other, since they are at different potentials with respect to each other. This becomes increasingly difficult as the number of tubes is made larger. Despite these objections, voltage-multiplying circuits using metallic-oxide rectifiers and crystal diodes are quite popular for low-current applications, such as TV power supplies.
