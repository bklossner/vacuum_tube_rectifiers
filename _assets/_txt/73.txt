Solution: (Refer to Figure 31.) Reference to Table I shows that the peak inverse voltage that each rectifier tube must withstand is 3,500 x 2.09 = 7,320 volts and the peak plate current per tube is 3 x l.21 = 3.63 amperes; the average plate current is 3 x 0.333 = 1 ampere each tube. Inspection of Table III reveals that the lowest-power tube capable of meeting these requirements is the type 872-A, half-wave mercury-vapor tube. For a three-phase, half-wave rectifier three 872-A's will be needed.

Neglecting the DC resistance of the filter choke, each secondary leg of the power transformer must develop an rms voltage of 3,500 x 0.855 = 3000 volts (see Table I) and provide a secondary current of 3 x 0.58 = 1.74 amperes. Plus 10% for tube, transformer and filter drops, the secondary voltage per leg should be about 3,300 volts. Since the output power is 3,500 x 3 = 10.5 kw, the kva rating of the transformer primary (from Table I) should be 10.5 x 1.2 = 12. 7 kva. Adding again 10% to compensate for losses, the transformer should be rated at 14 kva. In addition, a filament winding must be provided, rated at 5 volts, 22.5 amperes, to supply the 5-volt, 7.5-ampere filaments of the three rectifier tubes.

A choke-input filter must be used, since this is the only type applicable to polyphase circuits. Assuming a minimum load current (bleeder or voltage divider) of 10% of the total, (0.3 ampere), the minimum input inductance (from Table II) becomes

A choke rated 3 henrys at full load should prove adequate. For a permissible ripple of 0.5% of the output, the chart (Table II)
