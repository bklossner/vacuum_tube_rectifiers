The Need for Filtering Out the Ripple

Although rectifier systems deliver an output voltage that always has the same polarity, the voltage is not suitable as DC supply for vacuum tubes because of the pulsations in the amplitude, or ripple. The ripple voltage may be thought of as an alternating voltage that fluctuates around the average value of the DC output voltage. The ripple voltage is not of a single frequency, as was previously assumed, but actually a fundamental frequency and a number of frequencies that are. multiples of the fundamental frequency, called harmonics. Thus, the second harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency, the third harmonic is three times the fundamental, and so on. The fundamental ripple frequency may be the same as the supply frequency (for the single-phase half-wave rectifier) or as high as six times the supply frequency (for the full-wave three-phase rectifier), depending on the rectifier circuit used. The amplitude (magnitude) of the fundamental component of the ripple voltage is always larger than that of any harmonic. When the value of the ripple voltage for a particular rectifier is stated, as in Chap. 5 (Table II), it usually takes into account the amplitudes of all the major harmonics and is expressed either as the percentage of the average DC output voltage or as the ratio of the rms ripple voltage to the average DC output voltage.

Depending on the application, varying amounts of ripple may be tolerated, but it must always be a relatively low percentage of the DC output voltage. Devices for reducing the ripple voltage are known as filters. Filter circuits generally consist of capacitors, inductors, and sometimes resistors. The capacitors are always connected in parallel with the load, while the inductors or resistors are connected in series with the load.
