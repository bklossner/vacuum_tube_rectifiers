Inductance Filter

The action of a single inductor (choke coil), placed in series with the rectifier output, is illustrated in Fig. 22. This filter is usually used in combination with shunt capacitors, as we shall see later.

Essentially, any inductor opposes a change in the magnitude of the current flowing through it by storing up energy in its magnetic field when the current tends to increase, and by taking energy away from the field to maintain current flow when the voltage across the inductor tends to decrease. Hence, by placing a choke coil in series with the rectifier and load, abrupt changes in the magnitude of the rectifier output current and the load voltage are minimized. Another way of looking at the action of the series inductor is to consider that the coil offers a very low resistance (only that of the winding) to the passage of de, while offering at the same time a high impedance to the passage of fluctuating or alternating currents. The DC passes through, and the ripple is largely reduced.

As shown by the output waveform in Fig. 22, the load current through the filter (and hence the load voltage) lags 90Â° behind the rectifier output voltage and never reaches its peak value. The average DC output voltage from a single inductor is less than that from the capacitor filter, but the voltage does not fall off as rapidly with increases in load current as with a capacitor filter.
