In the next chapter a number of curves will be presented from
which the reduction factor for L-C filters with various rectifier
circuits can be determined without elaborate computation.

33. Tuned (Resonant) Filters
By using a resonant circuit as a filter, a particular ripple frequency
may be effectively suppressed. As shown in Figs. 28 and 29,
either a series-resonant circuit in parallel with the load or a
parallel-resonant circuit in series with the load, may be used to
suppress the ripple.

In the series-resonant filter circuit (Fig. 28) the reactance of
the coil and that of the capacitor cancel out at the resonant (ripple) frequency and the opposition to the ripple voltage is thus only
the series resistance of the tuned circuit, which is essentially the
coil winding resistance. The filter, therefore, acts as a short circuit
across the load for the ripple frequency to which it is tuned,
while presenting almost infinite impedance to the DC output voltage.
In contrast, the parallel-resonant filter (Fig. 29) presents a very
high impedance (Q times the impedance of the coil) to the ripple
frequency to which it is tuned, while at the same time presenting
only the coil resistance to the flow of direct current. It effectively
blocks the passage of the ripple current to the load. Small ripple
currents that do get through are further by-passed to ground by
shunt capacitors C' and C".
