it to the cathode of V1 leaving an excessive positive charge, while electrons from the plate of V1 and the transformer secondary ﬂow into the lower plate of Cl giving it an excess negative charge.) Capacitor Cl becomes positively charged to the peak value (+E) of the transformer secondary voltage. This is shown in Fig. 11 by the brief charging pulse (A) ﬂowing through rectifier Vl during the first half-cycle.

During the next ac half-cycle (B) the top of the transformer secondary is negative and tube V1 does not conduct. Since the tube is an open circuit, the charge and voltage on capacitor C1 remains essentially constant, except for a small amount that leaks through the load resistance. This is shown in Fig. 11 by the slow dropping off of the dc output voltage. During half-cycle (B) the cathode of V2 becomes negative with respect to its plate. Diode V2 passes a current in the direction of the dotted arrows, which charges up capacitor C2 negatively to the peak value (—E) of the transformer secondary voltage. The brief charging pulse ﬂowing through V2 is shown by current waveform (B) in Fig. 11. With a peak voltage (EA) on capacitor C1 and a peak voltage (EB) on capacitor C2, the total dc output voltage taken across the two capacitors is 2E. Thus the full-wave doubler supplies a no-load dc output voltage twice the peak of the transformer sec-
