onally opposite corners of the network, while the output to the load is taken from the remaining two corners. The circuit is a full-wave type, since both halves of the ac input cycle are utilized. Two tubes in series carry the load current on alternate half-cycles. The bridge circuit now makes maximum use of the power supply.

Operation. Assume that the polarities are such that the top of the transformer secondary winding is initially positive during the first half-cycle (A) of the ac supply voltage. During this half-cycle the transformer secondary voltage may be considered to be applied across a series circuit, consisting of rectifier tube Vl, the load resistor, and tube V2. Since the cathode of V1 is at maximum negative potential and the plate of V2 at maximum positive po- tential, an electron current ﬂows through Vl, the load resistor V2, and the transformer secondary, in the direction indicated by the solid arrows. During this first half-cycle the plates of tubes V3 and V4 are more negative than their cathodes and, hence, these do not conduct. Thus, the half-cycle (A) is reproduced by the conducting tubes V1 and V2 and across the load resistor, as illustrated by the waveforms (A) in Fig. 10.

One half-cycle (B) later, the top of the transformer secondary is negative and the bottom is positive, so that tubes V1 and V2 cannot conduct. However, the plates of V3 and V4 are now positive with respect to their cathodes and an electron current ﬂows through V3, the load resistor, and the transformer secondary,
