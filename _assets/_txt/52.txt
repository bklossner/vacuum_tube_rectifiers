output capacitor (C) charges up to the peak value. However, if even small load current is drawn, the DC output voltage drops rapidly to some lower value and then remains fairly constant over a wide range of load-current values. The initial sharp drop occurs because the series inductor prevents the capacitor from charging to the peak voltage when a load current is drawn. After this initial drop there is good voltage regulation of the choke-input filter.

Bleeder Resistor. A bleeder resistor connected across the filter output is generally designed to draw sufficient current for operation in the beginning of the almost constant portion of the voltage-current curve of the filter output, where the voltage regulation is excellent (Fig. 26A). By placing a load across the output, the bleeder becomes useful also in preventing high-voltage surges through the power supply when the equipment is first turned on. For satisfactory operation, the bleeder should draw about 10% of the rated load current.

Waveforms. The voltage and current relations in a choke-input filter are illustrated by the waveforms in Fig. 24. The load current in the choke coil lags behind the rectifier output voltage, as shown, and has a small ripple. The DC output voltage across C and the load is substantially constant, as indicated by the dotted line, and its value is somewhat less than the peak ac voltage, depending on the load current drawn. The ripple in the DC load current through the choke can be considerably reduced by increasing the value of the inductance. For an infinite inductance (the ideal case) the DC load-current waveform becomes a straight line equal to the average of the fluctuations shown in Fig. 24.
