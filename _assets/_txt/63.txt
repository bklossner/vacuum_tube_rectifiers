RECTIFIER AND FILTER DESIGN DATA

35. Rectifier Tube Characteristics

The choice of a rectifier tube is restricted to two major commercially available categories; high-vacuum thermionic types and hotcathode gas-filled types. High-vacuum rectifiers, available as halfwave or full-wave diodes, are used primarily for low power applications at plate voltages up to about 500 volts and load currents not exceeding a few hundred milliamperes. Because of their high peak voltages, high-vacuum diodes are also employed in applications requiring very high DC voltages at extremely small currents, such as for cathode-ray tube accelerating potentials. The hot-cathode gas diodes, ordinarily mercury-vapor types, find their chief application in industry and in transmitting stations, where high DC plate powers are required. Mercury-vapor tubes have low tube voltage drops (about 10 to 15 volts) compared to high-vacuum types, but must be preheated and protected from even momentary overloads. Because of the possibility of arcback, the peak inverse voltage of mercury-vapor tubes is critical, and dependent to some extent on the tube's ambient temperature. (See Chap. 1.)

The most important design ratings of representative commercial rectifier tubes are listed in Table III. The significance of these
