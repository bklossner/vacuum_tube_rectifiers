rectifier output voltage of a particular circuit for various loads and
filter component values. Such curves are frequently presented in
manufacturer's tube manuals, or the information for them may
be listed in tabular form under "typical operating conditions."

L-C Filter Design. Figure 27 shows typical examples of chokeinput
and capacitor-input filters of one or more sections which are
placed between the rectifier output and the load to obtain substantially
pure DC.

Note in Fig. 27 that for design purposes each filter section is
considered to be made up of a series inductance (choke coil) and
a shunt capacitor. The input inductance of a choke-input filter is
part of the first filter section, but the shunt capacitance (C) of a
capacitor-input filter is included not as part of the first filter
section, but as an integral part of the rectifier output. With the
input capacitor considered as part of the rectifier, the filter sections
of choke-input and capacitor-input circuits become identical. Then
rectifier output and ripple voltage that feeds into the series inductance
of a choke-input filter or into the shunt capacitance of a
capacitor-input filter must be determined. Now it is possible to compute
the reduction in the ripple voltage in the same way for both
types of filters. As stated before, the rectifier tube output voltages
(for typical operating conditions) into either an input inductance
or a shunt capacitor are listed in manufacturersâ€¢ tube manuals.

When the reactance of the shunt capacitance of an L-C filter
section is small at the lowest ripple frequency compared to the
load resistance (or the reactance of th( inductor that follows),
which is always the case in practical filters, the reduction is the
ripple voltage for a single section may be computed from the
following approximate relation:
